For problem 2, the closedhash tests show that it takes much more probes than is predicted
by the functions provided for the problem. I believe that this is perhaps due to the hashing
function that I used which I took straight from the book. This would cause non-random and less-
uniform distributing of values in the dictionary and would skew data considerably, as it appears
to have done.
